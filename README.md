## Reference Implementation
This project references and builds upon the mining logic from [ORE by Regolith Labs](https://github.com/regolith-labs/ore/tree/master/program/src).

We use their advanced hashing and reward distribution logic as a conceptual backbone and starting point. The original ORE implementation is used to guide the development of Killo’s energy-proof verification system.
